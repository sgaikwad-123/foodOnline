Git Bash

ls----gives list of files
code . -----open V S code or any other code editor
pip freeze  --- gives list of all installed packages on computer
 =====================================

1. create one folder and open git bash there
2.create virtual enviornment there ---python -m venv env
3.To activate virtual enviornment ----source env/scripts/activate
4.to deactivate the virtual enviornment ---- deactivate
---pip install django
---django-admin startproject foodOnline_main .
----code .

Noe V S code opened .now we will open new terminal from v S code .before that we need to exit from git bash . so we will ---deactivate the env from that git bash terminal and exit from that terminal.

----pip freeze
asgiref==3.9.1
Django==5.2.5
sqlparse==0.5.3
tzdata==2025.2

----first urls.py set path for home 
----second create new file views.py and write functions like home about and all
----now open git account, create new repository ,on v s code terminal write command like git init here we can see address of newly created repository.
---now we are creating .gitignore file into main directory. go to gitignore.io website and type django and click on create. now created file should paste on gitignore file. 
--- git add -A ------to add all changes.
----git commit -m "first commit"
---git push ...
---------
now add templates folder into direcory and in the DIR=['templates'] into template section of settings.py file . add home.html file into template folder and also update views.py file use render ...
-----because of no table exist for admin section we need to run this python manage.py migrate. Then python manage.py createsuperuser---and add username ,email ,password-
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'admin'): Djangoadmin
Email address: djangoadmin@gmail.com
Password: Djangoadmin
Password (again): Djangoadmin
The password is too similar to the username.
Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: y
Superuser created successfully.--------------
we are looking for online template-Rohitkumar buy the template and make it available for us free. its downloaded from https://freetemplate.rathank.com/  
it is downloaded and opened into django template as home.html and there we need to change some addresses .
---to collect all the static files we need to run this file ...python manage.py collectstatic.

we are using postgressql database because it is MVCC it stores large amount of data and also concurency is there means at a time 1000 users can access the data and saves the data.performance is very good.
postgres is downloaded and installed . password is admin. search pgadmin and open it . now create database there.
updated settings.py file and installed psycopg2 . pip install psycopg2.
there is django creating default tables for that we need to run python manage.py migrate. actually before this command in postgres table section is empty.
in the postres created all default tables automatically by running python manage.py migrate command. there is auth_user table where user details get stored . we will create superuser by python manage.py createsuperuser .the details like email username gets store into auth_user table. 
now username-djangoadmin,password-admin@123,email-djangoadmin@gmail.com,saved into auth_user table.

when we direct push code on github there is chances to share secrete key ,password and email_id because our repository is public to prevent this we have django feature that is decouple.on the browser type decouple there will get commands and some settings . copy pip install python-decouple and install from v s code terminal.

add from decouple import config in the settings.py file.also create .env file from main folder and secrete key from settings.py file.
